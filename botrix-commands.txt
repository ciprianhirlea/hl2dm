Usefull definitions
===================

Waypoint path defines a connection between 2 waypoints. Current path is a path
from current waypoint (nearest one, use 'botrix waypoint reset' command to
reset) to waypoint destination (use 'botrix waypoint destination' command to
set or just aim at waypoint to set destination).

Items are objects on the map, such as weapons, bullets, health-kits, armor,
buttons, doors, boxes, etc. They are defined in the MOD's configuration file.
